name: Scanner Integration Tests

# This workflow validates that scanner outputs remain consistent across changes.
# It compares scan results against committed versions to detect regressions.
# Update results when scanner behavior intentionally changes:
#   1. Run `make test-integration` locally
#   2. Review changes: `git diff example/scan-results/`
#   3. Commit results: `git add example/scan-results/ && git commit -m 'Update scan results'`
