# Scanner Integration Test Results

This directory contains scan results from running all Upcast scanners on the blueking-paas example project.

Results are generated by `make test-integration` and used for:

- Manual inspection of scanner output
- CI validation against baseline
- Documentation of scanner capabilities

Do not commit these files - they are regenerated on each test run.
